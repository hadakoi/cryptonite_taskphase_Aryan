# USB100

## Solving

```
In shocking turn of events, a malicious actor managed to gain physical access to our victim's computer by plugging in a rogue usb device.
As a result all critical data has been pilfered from system.
```

In this challenge they had provided us with a ``send.pcapng`` file (Packet Capture Next Generation) that is used for capturing and storing data. Now essentially what this pcapng file is, logging activities related to the use of USB device that generates network traffic.

So first let us open this file within wireshark where we see the transmission of USB packets hence we know the packets being transferred are in large amounts of data so lets look at those parts specifically. Leftover Capture Data refers to the portion of the packet capture file that remains after the main capture session has ended. This data typically consists of incomplete or unprocessed packet information that might not have been fully captured or saved when the capture was stopped.

From this we can see alot of file headers most likely for downloading images these are of the format of ``JFIF``exporting the packets for these we find that they are just **Ricing Linux wallpaper materials** lmfao, Now looking further we find the file header for the ``MZ`` type file which is executable.

Now there is also a message saying **"This program cannot be run in DOS mode"** which means that it was not run in the correct environment so extracting the leftover capture data as an exe file then running it returns us the flag.

I.E looking at all the jpg images are pre cool wallpaper material will be finding high res of them in the future.
