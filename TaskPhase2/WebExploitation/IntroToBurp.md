# IntroToBurp

## Method

This challenge requires us to intercept the request to capture the flag.

We can do this using BurpSuite. We first start up burpsuite and enter a new project file.

We can then enter the proxy tab. Where we then open a browser through burpsuite.
It is used to intercept and inspect HTTP/S traffic between your browser (or other client) and a web server.

In this challenge we are using it to Intercept and modify requests/responses in real time.

We then have to keep the intercept option on.  When intercept is on it pauses the proxy's tab where we can then edit headers parameters and cookies.

Upon entering the website we are prompted to login and enter our details. We do so and are directed to a page which requires an otp. However we have no idea what the otp is. In one of our hints we are told the server doesent handle malformed requests to well. So we can just make sure not to pass an otp. To bypass it we can intercept a request where we pass something to the otp to which we then edit out. After this we forward the request to see our flag.
