# IntroToBurp

## Method

This challenge requires us to intercept the request to capture the flag.

We can do this using BurpSuite. We first start up burpsuite and enter a new project file.

We can then enter the proxy tab. Where we then open a browser through burpsuite.
It is used to intercept and inspect HTTP/S traffic between your browser (or other client) and a web server.

In this challenge we are using it to Intercept and modify requests/responses in real time.

We then have to keep the intercept option on.  When intercept is on it pauses the proxy's tab where we can then edit headers parameters and cookies.

Upon entering the website we are prompted to login and enter our details. We do so and are directed to a page which requires an otp. However we have no idea what the otp is. In one of our hints we are told the server doesent handle malformed requests to well.

The request section in Burp Suite shows the HTTP headers sent to the server when you visit a website.
Each of these headers provides the server with details about how to respond to the client's request. They carry metadata about requests and responses exchanged between a client and a server.
These headers originate from our computer forming the request sent to the web server.

Notes related to this - 

When you enter a URL or click a link your browser prepares an HTTP request. 
This request includes headers that provide context and specifics about the request.

Headers like Host, User-Agent, Accept, and Accept-Language are automatically generated
Cookies stored from previous interactions with that site are automatically attached to the request

Once the request is assembled the browser sends it over the network to the destination web server.
The server receives your request reads the headers to understand who you are and what you require.

---

At the bottom of the requests section we can see Data Payload containing the form data being sent to the server.

As such when enter an otp to the website and try to submit we can see the otp payload at the bottom of the request section.

So we can just make sure not to pass an otp. To bypass it we can intercept a request where we pass something to the otp to which we then edit out. After this we forward the request to see our flag.
