# Some Assembly Required 1

## Method

We have been given No description for this question but rather the website. Considering they have explained we need to access the wasm which is a binary format instruction address.
When I inspected the webpage in Chrome i could see a wasm option under sources under further investigation. scrolling to the bottom i found the flag. 
This only doable on chrome as it has devtools.


WebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format designed for high-performance execution on the web. 
It allows developers to compile code from languages like C, C++, and Rust into a compact binary format that runs in web browsers at near-native speed. 
Wasm provides a secure, sandboxed environment and enables seamless integration with JavaScript
