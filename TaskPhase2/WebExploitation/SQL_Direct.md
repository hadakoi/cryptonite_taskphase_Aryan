# SQL Direct

## Method

In this challenge we are promted to 
```bash
psql -h saturn.picoctf.net -p 49665 -U postgres pico
```
With the password **postgres**

This command connects us to a PostgreSQL database using the psql command-line interface.
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for storing, managing, and retrieving data.

It connects to the pico database on the PostgreSQL server located at saturn.picoctf.net, using the postgres user and connecting via port 49665.

Our hint for this challenge is : What does a SQL database contain?

An SQL database contains Tables

In PostgreSQL tables are database objects that store data in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. Each row represents a unique record and each column represents a field or attribute of that record.
To access tables we can use the commands
```bash
\dt
```
This lists all of the tables with this format.
 List of relations
 
 ``Schema | Name  | Type  |  Owner``

 - Schema: The namespace or "category" within the database where the table resides. Schemas help organize tables and other objects.
 - Name: The name of the table in the database
 - The type of relation; here, itâ€™s usually "table" 
 - Owner: The username of the account that owns or created the table

```bash
select * from flags;
```
This allows us to view all rows and columns in the flags table.

This command retrieves every row in the flags table.
Each column in the table will display its data.

From here we can just see the flag.

We can then use exit to exit the connection to the sql.

**Note** we can also see all the objects in a database using the command

```bash
\d
```
