# Power Cookie 

## Method

In this challenge we are given a website where we are required to investigate ourselves for the flag.

Based on the prompt it has something to do with cookies.

Entering the website and trying to authenticate we are greeted with We apologize, but we have no guest services at the moment.

Upon trying the website authenticate inside burpsuite we can see that it has a http header called ``Cookie: isAdmin=0``. we can Intercept this request and change it to 1. 
Ideally hopefully giving us admin.

This header is used to send cookies from the client (typically a web browser) to the server. 

In this case isAdmin=0 is used to keep track of the user's role.

isAdmin essentially means wether you are an admin or not 0 = not an admin 1 = an admin.
quite literally over here we are changing our cookie which stores the user permission before its being forwarded to the web server.

Once we have changed it to 1 and forward the request we can see the flag.

**NOTE:**
cookies refer specifically to the data stored in the user's web browser that tracks and manages user information for web applications.

```
Cookie: isAdmin=1
```
