# Who Are You

## Method

Upon opening the website we are greeted with 
```
Only people who use the official PicoBrowser are allowed on this site!
```
This literally refers to us changing our user-agent to PicoBrowser in the requests section
Using burpsuite to intercept the request then changing it and forwarding.

```bash
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
```
By spoofing the header to look like itâ€™s coming from an allowed browse we can bypass certain restrictions.

---

we can see this now 

```
I don't trust users visiting from another site.
```

This is literally a hint as to what you need to change the Referer header in your HTTP request to match the URL of the website we are trying to access.
We can do this by adding this in the requests section

```bash
Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:46199

```

Basically we make this the same as the Host: section.
The Referer header indicates the address of the webpage that linked to the resource being requested. Essentially, it tells the server where the user came from so in this case we needed to make it the same site.

we can see this now

```
Sorry, this site only worked in 2018.
```

From this hint it is assumed we must change another header in requests such as the date.
We can do this by adding the Date: Header.\

```bash
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT
```

this essentially spoofs the date that the request appears to be sent from the client

---

we can see this now 
```
I don't trust users who can be tracked.
```
From this hint we can understand we must add a header so that we cannot be tracked.
This header refers to DNT: .

```bash
DNT: 1
```

this essentially indicates the user's preference for "Do Not Track."

---

we can see this now
```
This website is only for people from Sweden.
```

From this hint we can tell that we must change our IP address to one from sweden.
We can do this using X-Forwarded-For: ipaddresssweden.

```bash
X-Forwarded-For: 192.44.242.19
```
this spoofs the originating IP address that a web server sees in the request making it seem as though we are from sweden.

---

we can see this now 
```
You're in Sweden but you don't speak Swedish?
```

From this hint we can tell that we must edit the language header to one that is in swedish.
Ths is **sv**


```bash

Accept-Language: sv-SE,sv;q=0.9
```

sv-SE: This specifies the Swedish language as spoken in Sweden
sv: This is the general language code for Swedish

This essentially is spoofing the request to make it appear as though your client (browser or tool) is communicating in Swedish.

Finally we get the flag.

---

Our Requests area in burp suite will look like this now.

---


```bash
Accept-Language: sv-SE,sv;q=0.9
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
User-Agent: PicoBrowser
Referer: mercury.picoctf.net:46199
Date: Thu, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 GMT
DNT: 1
X-Forwarded-For: 192.44.242.19
```
